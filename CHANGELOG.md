## [0.1.4] - 2020-09-11

### NOTE: We skipped v0.1.3 due to testing the release process!

### Bugfixes

- Browser
  - Login now clears the local storage, so that you can log into a different server
even if not logged out properly.

### Internal refactor:
- Created multiple sub-packages, specifically the core and oidc-dpop-client-browser.
- Moved interfaces down into Core.
- Removed TSyringe annotations from the implementation of StorageUtility in the
 Core package and extended it in the browser module (where they we re-applied to
 allow injection again).
