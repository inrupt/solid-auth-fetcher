# solid-client-authn

`solid-client-authn` is a set of libraries designed to authenticate with Solid identity servers and make requests to Solid storage servers from JavaScript client deployed in any environment. `solid-client-authn` libraries have a common API, and come in different modules:
- `solid-client-authn-browser` is available to build web apps in the browser.
- `solid-client-authn-node` is **planned** to build server-side apps.

## Using the Appropriate API

The different `solid-client-authn` libraries all share the same interface ([see API reference](./docs/api.md)). `solid-client-authn` includes two APIs for building applications: a "Single Session API" and a "Multi Session API".

### When to use the "Single Session API"

`solid-client-authn`'s "Single Session API" is designed to provide a streamlined experience to implementing authentication in apps that are focused on one user. You'd use the single session api to

 - Create a single page web application that only one user logs into at a time.
 - Make a bot that only represents one user.
 - Build a mobile application that only one user logs into at a time.

#### Examples Usage

 - [Single-session the web browser with your own bundler](./examples/single/bundle)

### When to use "Multi Session API"

`solid-client-authn`'s "Multi Session API" allows you to manage multiple sessions for multiple logged in users. You'd use the multi session api to

 - Create a web application with a server side component. While one user may be logged into each individual client, the server will need to manage all logged in users.
 - Make a bot that needs to handle multiple users.
 - You have a single page application, but you want to maintain credentials on the server for security.
 - You want to log in multiple identities for either a single human user or multiple users.

### Setting up the examples

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn.git
cd solid-client-authn
npm ci
npm run bootstrap-examples
# Run each example
npm run dev-single-bundle
```

At this point, a test application will be running on port `3001`.
Be sure that you type in a valid solid issuer before logging in.
