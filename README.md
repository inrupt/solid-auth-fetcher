# Solid JavaScript Authentication - solid-client-authn

`solid-client-authn` is a suite of libraries designed to authenticate with Solid identity servers.
The libraries share a common API and include different modules for different deployment environments:

- `solid-client-authn-browser` can be used to build web apps in the browser.
- `solid-client-authn-node` is **planned** to build server-side and console-based apps. (NOT AVAILABLE YET)

@inrupt/solid-client-authn libraries are part of a suite open source JavaScript libraries designed to support developers building Solid applications.

# Inrupt Solid JavaScript Client Libraries

## Data access and permissions management - solid-client

[@inrupt/solid-client](https://docs.inrupt.com/client-libraries/solid-client-js/) allows developers to access data and manage permissions on data stored in Solid Pods.

## Authentication - solid-client-authn-browser
[@inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser) allows apps running on a browser to authenticate against a Solid server. This is necessary when the resources on your Pod are not public.

## Vocabularies and interoperability - solid-common-vocab-rdf

[@inrupt/solid-common-vocab-rdf](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-common-vocab-rdf) allows developers to build interoperable apps by reusing well-known vocabularies. These libraries provide vocabularies available as constants that you just have to import.
